<p>One dataset which could be represented in a force diagram is a graph of the atoms making up a chemical compound, such as butane. Each node could represent an atom, and each edge could represent a chemical bond. This would be a highly intuitive layout, since molecules are usually drawn as graphs of atoms, with each node being a letter representing an atom and each edge representing a bond. Perhaps the size and color of each node could change based on the atomic mass of the node’s corresponding atom, and the edge length could reflect the corresponding bond length.</p>
<p>Another dataset which could be represented in a force diagram is a network of metabolic pathways, such as the one depicted on this <a href="http://homepage.ufp.pt/pedros/bq/integration.htm">website</a>. Each node represents a compound in a biochemical pathway, and each edge represents a chemical reaction transforming one compound into another. Networks of chemical pathways are often illustrated as graphs by biochemists. Perhaps clicking on each node could display more information about the properties or function of each compound, and perhaps hovering over each edge could display the enzyme involved in that reaction.</p>
<p>A third dataset which could be represented in a force diagram is a graph of major American cities and the highways which connect them. Each node corresponds to a city, and each edge corresponds to a road. Perhaps the length of each edge could correspond to the length of the corresponding highway, and the size of the node could correspond to that city’s population. That force diagram wouldn’t be helpful for communicating specific geographical details, but it may help convey a generalized, abstract overview of the US highway system.</p>
<p>A fourth dataset which could be represented in a force diagram is a graph of astronomical constellations, such as the big dipper. Each node corresponds to a star in that constellation, and each edge corresponds to the imaginary lines between each star. The length of the edge could be modified to reflect the distance between each star in the actual night sky. Perhaps the color and size of each node could depend on the size and type of that star, and hovering over the node could display pertinent astronomical data.</p>
